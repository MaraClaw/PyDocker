# PyWhales Agent Guide

## Overview

PyWhales is a typed Python wrapper around the external Docker CLI, not a Docker HTTP SDK.
Python >=3.14.10 and Pydantic 2 are required; `.python-version` pins 3.14.10.
The public API exports `DockerClient`, resource classes, a shared `docker` client, and the inventory and observation entry points from `pywhales/__init__.py`.
`DockerClient` wires 18 command groups to one `ClientConfig` and exposes convenience aliases such as `run`, `ps`, and `build`.
Importing the package or constructing a client doesn't check CLI, daemon, or plugin availability.
The installed `pywhales` console entry point only prints a notice; it isn't a Docker command runner.

Bounded observation sits on top of the command groups:

- `observation()` nests explicit limits, deadlines, and cancellation over launches. `capture_inventory()` returns a typed `InventorySnapshot` of detached inspect records for 13 kinds: container, image, network, volume, node, service, config, secret, task, plugin, context, builder, and manifest_list.
- `pywhales.convergence.wait()` watches a captured Swarm service generation, a fixed stack membership, or a Compose project's selected long-running and completion services. It ends in success, failure, deadline, or cancellation and never mutates anything.
- `admission`, `convergence`, `profiles`, `reconciliation`, and `storage` are opt-in application packages. Import them explicitly: `pywhales/__init__.py` doesn't re-export them, and direct `DockerClient` calls stay permissive without them.
- `telemetry` is optional payload-free launch records with no monitoring dependency or worker.

## Structure And Navigation

| Path | Start here for |
| --- | --- |
| `pywhales/docker_client.py` | Public client, command-group wiring, top-level aliases |
| `pywhales/client_config.py` | Shared client options, command assembly, reloadable resource bases |
| `pywhales/_execution_policy.py` | Originating-config carrier and per-launch execution policy |

| `pywhales/_observation.py` | Context-local limits, deadlines, and cancellation checkpoints |
| `pywhales/_bounded_capture.py`, `pywhales/_scoped_launch.py`, `pywhales/_launch_limits.py` | Bounded interruptible capture and launch preflight; related helpers are `_capture_pipes.py`, `_readiness.py`, `_archive_deadline.py`, `_stdin_pump.py`, `_environment.py` |
| `pywhales/utils.py` | Subprocess execution, common conversions, Pydantic model base |

| `pywhales/_environment.py` | Effective child environments and safe container `envs` forwarding |
| `pywhales/telemetry/` | Launch and completion records plus the bounded exporter; no child guide, covered by `pywhales/AGENTS.md` |
| `pywhales/convergence/` | Service and Compose convergence: `_wait.py` entry points, `_service.py`, `_compose.py`, `_wire.py`, `_types.py` |
| `pywhales/admission/` | Application-owned synchronous admission: class limits, saturation policy, queueing, admitted streams |
| `pywhales/profiles/` | Application create policy: `plan_create` builds a plan, `create_from_plan` applies it |
| `pywhales/reconciliation/` | Desired-state controller, operation journal, adapters; only an in-memory store ships |
| `pywhales/storage/` | Non-destructive retention planning, immutable approvals, pressure assessment and gate |
| `pywhales/components/` | Docker command groups; start with each group's `cli_wrapper.py` and `models.py` where present |
| `tests/` | Pytest suite, shared runtime fixtures, static type contracts |
| `docs/` | Editable templates, API-doc generation, MkDocs configuration |
| `scripts/` | Contributor tooling, not installed APIs: CI provisioning, plugin installation, overhead benchmark |
| `scripts/fleet_contract/` | Offline fleet contract: strict manifest, support, and result schemas, validators, non-qualifying reports (see its `README.md`) |
| `scripts/fleet_harness/` | Fake-only offline capacity simulation and non-authorizing transport decisions built on the contract |
| `scripts/delivery/` | Tested delivery chain run by CI: smoke, seal, publish, release, and Pages helpers |
| `skills/pywhales/` | Consumer skill for using the installed library, not a contributor workflow |
| `.github/workflows/` | Authoritative CI checks, docs build, and the delivery chain from package build to release and Pages |
| `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `.python-version` | Project/tool configuration, locked dependencies, interpreter pin |

## Code Map

| Symbol | File | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DockerClient` | `pywhales/docker_client.py` | Public facade and shared-config command-group wiring |
| `ClientConfig` | `pywhales/client_config.py` | Dataclass holding CLI, connection, Compose, and execution settings |
| `Command` | `pywhales/client_config.py` | Argument-list builder with option/flag helpers |
| `ReloadableObject` | `pywhales/client_config.py` | Resource identity and refreshed inspection data |
| `DockerCamelModel` | `pywhales/utils.py` | Pydantic base mapping Python names to Docker JSON aliases |
| `ProcessStream` | `pywhales/_process_stream.py` | Iterator owning a CLI process and streamed output |
| `observation` | `pywhales/_observation.py` | Context manager nesting limits, deadline, and cancel tokens |
| `capture_inventory` | `pywhales/inventory.py` | Public entry that delegates to `_inventory_capture.py` |
| `wait` | `pywhales/convergence/_wait.py` | Convergence wait; `capture_service` and `capture_compose` build its targets |

Code-map discovery uses graph symbols, LSP outlines/references, and AST import searches. Editor references also match ignored `build/lib/pywhales` copies and are capped: don't quote them as exact source-only counts. Prefer graph tracing, or exclude `build/`, `dist/`, and `.venv/`.

## Guide Scope

- Read this root guide first, then the nearest child `AGENTS.md` for files you're changing.
- `pywhales/AGENTS.md`: shared runtime internals, observation and inventory capture, and telemetry.
- `pywhales/components/AGENTS.md`: command-group patterns. Buildx, Compose, container, image, manifest, and service directories have their own guides; Buildx also covers imagetools.
- Opt-in packages: `pywhales/admission/AGENTS.md`, `pywhales/convergence/AGENTS.md`, `pywhales/profiles/AGENTS.md`, `pywhales/reconciliation/AGENTS.md`, and `pywhales/storage/AGENTS.md`.
- `scripts/AGENTS.md`: tooling and provisioning hazards. Delivery, fleet contract, and fleet harness have child guides; `scripts/fleet_contract/README.md` remains authoritative for contract commands and semantics.
- `tests/AGENTS.md`: test selection and fixture details. `docs/AGENTS.md`: generation mechanics and the documentation pipeline.

## Commands From CI

Run from the repository root. These commands mirror `.github/workflows/python-package.yml` and `python-publish.yml`.
The strict coverage command is an integration run, not a safe default for a workstation daemon.

| Purpose | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Install locked development environment | `uv sync --locked` |
| Lint | `uv run --locked ruff check ./` |
| Check formatting | `uv run --locked ruff format --check ./` |
| Check types and static contracts | `uv run --locked ty check` |
| Full strict suite with coverage, disposable daemon only | `uv run --locked coverage run -m pytest -vv -ra --no-runtime-skip --durations=10` |
| Enforce coverage floor | `uv run --locked coverage report` |
| Generate documentation sources | `uv run --locked python -m docs.autogen` |
| Build documentation site | `uv run --locked mkdocs build --config-file docs/mkdocs.yml` |
| Build source and wheel distributions | `uv build --no-sources --sdist --wheel` |

After the build, CI runs `python -m scripts.delivery smoke`. The seal, prepare, confirm, release, and pages subcommands are privileged GitHub and PyPI steps; don't run them locally.

## Conventions And Checks

- Follow [the Python docstring standard](docs/python-docstrings.md) for new or changed Python module, class, function, and method docstrings; do not rewrite unrelated docstrings.
- Treat Ruff and ty settings in `pyproject.toml` as authoritative, not legacy `.flake8` or `.isort.cfg` files.
- Ruff targets Python 3.14 and handles import sorting as well as linting and formatting. Its checks cover `scripts/` too.
- ty checks `pywhales`, `tests`, and `docs`; all rules are errors and warnings fail the check.
- Root ty excludes `scripts/`, including `scripts/delivery`. Use the scoped ty commands in `scripts/delivery/AGENTS.md` and `scripts/fleet_contract/README.md`.
- ty doesn't respect type-ignore suppression comments; fix types rather than adding those comments.
- Static `assert_type` contracts in `tests/pywhales/test_type_contracts.py` and related files are checked by ty, not exercised by pytest.
- Coverage is measured for `pywhales` with a 90% minimum; `coverage report` enforces it.
- Keep dependency changes consistent with `uv.lock` and the interpreter pin; normal checks use `--locked`.
- A version bump needs a matching `## <version>` section in `CHANGELOG.md`: the delivery seal reads it as the release notes and rejects a missing, empty, or duplicate section.
- Public names of the opt-in packages come from each package's `__init__.py`; underscore modules are internal.
- Follow existing CLI argument and return-type contracts; check convenience aliases when changing component APIs.

## Safety And Generated Files

- The integration suite is destructive: use a disposable Docker daemon, not one holding valuable containers, images, volumes, or Swarm state.
- `--no-runtime-skip` only affects the session `docker_client` fixture in `tests/conftest.py`: a missing executable, failed version probe, or timeout fails instead of skipping. CI passes it, but it doesn't gate separately built or global clients, plugins, or the collection-time `compose.is_installed()` skip in `tests/pywhales/components/test_compose.py`, which skips independently. See `tests/AGENTS.md`.
- `scripts/ci-setup.sh` calls `scripts/add-local-docker-registry.sh`, which overwrites `/etc/docker/daemon.json` and restarts Docker with sudo.
- That setup also installs plugins; it's CI provisioning, not safe workstation setup. Don't run it casually.
- `scripts/download-docker-plugins.sh` downloads checksum-pinned Linux amd64 plugins into `$DOCKER_CONFIG/cli-plugins` (default `~/.docker/cli-plugins`). Treat it as CI provisioning too.
- Don't run publication, release, or deployment operations of `scripts.delivery` against the production repository. Local delivery tests use inert stubs.
- `scripts/fleet_contract` and `scripts/fleet_harness` are offline: no Docker, daemon, or network. Their output never qualifies or authorizes a live run, so keep credentials and private endpoints out of their input files.
- `PYWHALES_DEBUG=1` enables execution diagnostics that withhold command, environment, and captured-output values by default.
  `DockerClient(raw_diagnostics=True)` opts that client into raw diagnostics; see `pywhales/AGENTS.md` for the confidentiality boundary.
- Documentation generation is Docker-free by default. `--live-examples` explicitly opts into real Docker operations.
- Edit `docs/template/` and source docstrings, not generated documentation output.
- `docs/generated_sources/`, `site/`, and `docs/site/` are ignored outputs; don't commit generated sources or site files.
- Keep build output, caches, virtual environments, and package metadata out of source changes.
