    """Account for archive pipe I/O and reap an expired local child.

    Counters include successful writes and reads, never submitted buffer sizes.
    The pipe lock serializes caller I/O with watchdog drains. Reap the process
    and join thread before publishing counters; a deadline is optional.

    Pipe waits are readiness waits made under the pipe lock, so the watchdog
    never closes a pipe beneath one. A wait lasts the remaining time to the
    deadline, which is when the watchdog needs the lock to expire the child,
    and has no timer at all without a deadline or after a natural exit.

    An observation snapshotted at launch adds its own deadline and cancel
    tokens, and keeps them after its ``with`` block exits. The watchdog expires
    the child when the scope ends first, and ``check()`` then raises
    ``ObservationTimeout`` or ``ObservationCancelled`` once the child is
    reaped. Tokens are plain events, so they add only the bounded cancel check
    to a wait. A command deadline reports ``DockerTimeout`` only when strictly
    earlier than the scope's, and a set token wins over both, as in a captured
    run. After a natural exit nothing is left to stop, but ``check()`` still
    reports a scope that ended before the transfer was delivered.
