# Admission Contracts

Opt-in, in-process FIFO admission around caller-supplied work. It adds no executor, doesn't change SDK child scheduling, and can't cancel daemon-side work. Stream and process lifecycle rules are in [the shared runtime guide](../AGENTS.md).

## Local Navigation

- `__init__.py`: public names live in `__all__`; everything else is internal.
- `_contracts.py`: frozen identities, `ClassLimit`, snapshots, and the `validate_*` helpers. `_errors.py`: `AdmissionError` subclasses and the bounded `RejectionReason`; messages carry no operation or connection payloads.
- `_owner.py`: `AdmissionOwner` owns one `Condition`, the per-class buckets, and the closed flag. `_acquire`, `_try_resize`, `_begin_close`, `_cancel`, and `_release` are its only lifecycle transitions.
- `_state.py`: `Ticket` and `Bucket` hold the FIFO deque, active and pending demand, high waters, and `Outcome` counters, all mutated under the owner lock.
- `_request.py`: `AdmissionRequest`. `_stream.py`: `AdmittedStream`. `_guard.py`: the reentry `ContextVar`.

## Owner And Queue

- Share the exact `AdmissionOwner` to share limits. Equal `EndpointIdentity` aliases never merge owners, and there is no global registry.
- A request is inert until `call()` or `stream()`. Only queued tickets are registered, user callables aren't retained, and `queue_timeout` starts at activation. `_acquire` computes the deadline before taking the lock, so lock wait counts against it.
- Grants are FIFO and head-only. The fast path needs an empty queue; a waiter proceeds only as `pending[0]` with active and demand capacity free. A head that doesn't fit blocks smaller followers on purpose. `demand_capacity` is per class, and `None` leaves demand unbounded.
- `try_resize` takes total demand, not a delta. Shrinking notifies waiters. Growth returns `False` unchanged when capacity is short or any request is pending, so it can't jump the queue.
- Every terminal path sets `ticket.done` and records one `Outcome`; `Bucket.dequeue` is idempotent. `close()` rejects and clears pending tickets and keeps active permits; afterward `_cancel` returns `False`. A dormant request rejects only when activated.
- `Outcome` values index `Bucket.counts`, and `Bucket.snapshot` builds `OutcomeCounts` positionally. A new outcome must update `OutcomeCounts`, `snapshot`, and the contract tests together. Counters saturate at `UINT64_MAX` and set `saturated`.
- `wait_drained` counts active permits only, never closes, runs the reentry check, and clamps each wait to `TIMEOUT_MAX`. Lock wait counts against its deadline too.
- `iter_calls` builds one request eagerly to validate arguments, then pulls exactly one callable per `next()`: no prefetch, no backlog.

## Reentry And Streams

- `operation_scope` adds the owner id to a `ContextVar` around user operations, stream factory and source entry, each `next()`, and source exit. Same-owner nesting in that context raises `AdmissionReentryError`; cross-thread nesting is unsupported.
- `AdmittedStream` holds one permit until source `__exit__` and any in-flight read finish. `_begin_close` is the only call that takes the owner lock while the stream lock is held, so don't add the reverse order. It ends resize eligibility without releasing the reservation.
- Source exit runs before waiting on an in-flight read so it can wake a blocked `next()`. `close()` is idempotent, concurrent closers wait for one cleanup owner, and a bare loop `break` keeps the permit.
- `__exit__` returns `False`. A cleanup failure after a body failure joins it in a `BaseExceptionGroup`; interrupted cleanup waits keep waiting and are combined, not dropped. Failed setup releases without exiting a half-entered source.
- One stream permit covers every child of its source, including composite image streams. Don't admit those children again through the same owner.

## Tests

Paths are under `tests/pywhales/`. None use the `docker_client` fixture: Docker call sites are patched, and real children are local `sys.executable` processes.

- `test_admission_contracts.py`, `test_admission_producer.py`: validation, frozen snapshots, saturation, pull-only `iter_calls`.
- `test_admission_calls.py`, `test_admission_waits.py`, `test_admission_weighted_queue.py`: zero-work rejection, FIFO bounds, cancel, queue and drain deadlines, demand ordering.
- `test_admission_streams.py`, `test_admission_stream_races.py`, `test_admission_processes.py`: cleanup order, error grouping, one permit over real children.
- `test_admission_resize.py`, `test_admission_resize_races.py`, `test_admission_concurrency.py`: reservation, close, cancel, and grant races.
- `test_admission_types.py` holds `assert_type` checks for `ty`; pytest collects nothing from it.
- Tests script `_owner.monotonic` with fixed call counts and wrap `owner._condition.wait` as the "queued" signal. Adding a clock read or moving a wait site in `_owner.py` needs matching test updates.

```bash
uv run --locked pytest tests/pywhales/test_admission_*.py -q
```

That selection includes concurrency and local-process cleanup tests but needs no daemon.
