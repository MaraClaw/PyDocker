# Image Component Guide

## Local Navigation

- `cli_wrapper.py`: `Image`, `ImageCLI`, batch inspection, transfers, copy helpers, and archives.
- `models.py`: inspect snapshots; `config` and `container_config` reuse `ContainerConfig`,
  while `ImageGraphDriver.data` accepts arbitrary JSON values, including scalars and null.
- `streams.py`: `MultiImageStream`, plus the `ImageStream` and `EmptyImageStream` type aliases.

## Pull And Push Contracts

- Deduplicate iterable references in first-seen order before choosing single or multiple transfers.
  An iterable pull still returns a list without streaming, even with one unique reference.
- `quiet=True` with `stream_logs=True` raises `ValueError` for both pull and push.
- Nonstreamed transfers are eager; multiple unique references use a four-worker `ThreadPool`
  through `streams.py::map_in_contexts`. Each task enters its own `copy_context()` made in the
  caller's thread; never share one `Context` across workers.
  Pull returns `Image` for a string or an ordered list for an iterable; push returns `None`.
- Inside `observation()`, only nonstreamed transfers reject `quiet=False`: `run()` raises `ValueError`
  for one reference or many. `stream_logs=True` accepts `quiet=False` there.
- `pull([], stream_logs=True)` returns owned `EmptyImageStream`: empty iteration, context-manager support and idempotent `close()`, without executable lookup or a child.
  Blocking `pull([])` stays `[]`; `push([])` stays `None` even with streaming enabled. Preserve this asymmetry and the `ImageStream`/`EmptyImageStream` type aliases.
- Validate `timeout` first: before references are consumed (strings, iterators, and `[]` alike), before
  push inspection, and before any CLI lookup. Empty requests keep their results after a valid timeout.
- Each transfer is timed from its own launch: every pool task, and every lazy or queued stream child once a
  worker starts it, never from queueing or group creation. Push batch-inspects deduplicated references before
  any transfer, streamed ones included; that inspection and a pull's handle inspection sit outside the deadline.
- Snapshot the selected byte budget (image override, else general) once at public `pull()`/`push()` entry,
  before consuming references or running push preflight.

## Multi-Image Streams

- `MultiImageStream` starts workers on first consumption, not construction or context entry.
  It owns active child streams and admits at most four concurrent transfers. It snapshots the
  creating context and runs each worker in a fresh copy, so children keep the creator's
  observation scope even if iteration starts after its `with` block.
- A single unique reference uses an eager `MappedProcessStream`, including duplicate-only input.
- Records are `(image_reference, bytes)`; don't promise global ordering across images or pipes.
- The first worker error, a child's `DockerTimeout` included, stops sibling work and queued transfers without
  waiting for consumption. Deliver that original error once through iteration, including after explicit `close()`.
- Snapshot the selected byte budget, including `None`, for the group queue and every eager, lazy, or queued
  child stream. Later budget mutations affect new public operations only. Pass `None` explicitly at
  the shared boundary so it stays unbounded. A record exceeding a configured budget raises `BufferError`.

## Inspection, Copy, And Archives

- Batch inspect must verify each snapshot's ID or normalized tag/digest aliases against its request.
  Positional pairing alone isn't identity validation; mismatches raise `ParsingError`.
- Normalization handles Docker Hub/library prefixes, implicit `:latest`, and tagged digest references.
  Keep typed inspect snapshots on returned images instead of fetching them again immediately.
- `copy_from()` copies through a temporary container; `copy_to()` copies into one and commits it,
  returning a new `Image` with optional `new_tag`. Both forward `pull`, defaulting to `"missing"`.
  Their `timeout` times each launch they make (inspect through removal) via `execution_timeout()`, not config mutation.
- `save()` rejects empty input and inspects references before saving. An output path returns `None`;
  omitted output returns an iterator of archive bytes. Don't treat it as a progress-log stream.
- Byte-input `load()` and lazy `save()` launch through `_prepare_archive_launch`, which validates the selected
  timeout (explicit, else the client default) before any process starts or input is read. A save's eager
  inspection stays outside the save deadline: it runs in an `execution_timeout()` scope that ends before any
  yield. A lazy save's clock starts at first iteration, using the client default as configured then.
- Path-based `load()` uses the general stream budget, not the pull/push override.
  Direct archive load/save subprocesses snapshot `raw_diagnostics` before launch for failure rendering;
  preserve archive payloads, exception classes, and raw attributes. Don't promise archive memory bounds.
- Automatic missing-image reference diagnostics require `raw_diagnostics=True`; fallback behavior is unchanged.

## Test Navigation

- `tests/pywhales/test_container_image_enum_json.py`: nested config and graph-driver JSON contracts.
- `tests/pywhales/components/test_image.py` contains mocked CLI and real child-process stream tests:
  `test_empty_image_operations_keep_existing_result_shapes`, `test_empty_pull_stream_is_owned_without_executable_resolution`,
  `test_multiple_image_stream_has_lazy_owned_lifecycle`,
  `test_multiple_image_stream_keeps_first_original_error`, `test_batch_inspect_image_aliases_and_typed_snapshot`.
- The same file covers fallback/override snapshots before preflight, lazy queued children, backpressure,
  path-load budgets, and safe/raw archive failures. Deadlines: `test_archive_lazy_save_explicit_timeout_starts_at_first_iteration`,
  `test_multi_image_timeout_is_launch_relative_not_group_relative`, `test_image_save_bounds_eager_inspection_with_override`,
  and `test_unquiet_transfer_in_a_scope_raises_the_same_error_for_one_or_many`.
- Daemon-free transfer deadlines: `tests/pywhales/components/test_deadline_forwarding.py` (mocked, e.g.
  `test_image_push_validates_before_consuming_or_inspecting`) and `test_command_deadlines.py` (local Python CLI,
  e.g. `test_push_inspect_preflight_is_outside_the_explicit_budget`). Static shapes: `tests/pywhales/test_command_deadline_types.py`.
- Copy forwarding uses `test_copy_from_pull` and `test_copy_to_pull`; archive integration includes `test_save_load`
  and `test_save_iterator_bytes`. Read fixtures before choosing daemon-free selections.
