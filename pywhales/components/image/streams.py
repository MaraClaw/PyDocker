    Workers start on the first `next()` call, not construction or context entry.
    Records contain an image reference and output bytes; interleaving across
    images and stdout/stderr is not globally ordered. Exhaustion waits for worker
    cleanup. Use a context manager or explicit `close()` when stopping early;
    a bare loop break leaves ownership with the caller.

    Closing cancels local CLI processes, not daemon-managed images. Worker errors
    stop active and queued sibling work without waiting for consumption. The
    first recorded error is raised once by iteration, including after explicit
    close; context exit itself only closes the group.

    The group snapshots the context it is created in, so every worker, whenever
    it starts, runs in its own copy of that context: children launch under the
    creator's observation scope, deadline, and tokens even if iteration begins
    after the ``with`` block that created the group has exited.
