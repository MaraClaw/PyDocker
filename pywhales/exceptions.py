    A kind is recognized only when a line starts with its own phrase, compared
    case-insensitively after an optional ``Error response from daemon: ``,
    ``<token>: Error response from daemon: ``, or ``Error: `` prefix. The phrases
    are ``No such <kind>`` for image, service, container, volume, config, secret,
    and plugin; ``<kind> <name> not found`` for service, network, config, and
    secret; ``get <name>: no such volume``; ``plugin "<name>" not found``;
    ``context "<name>": context not found``; ``context "<name>" does not exist``;
    and ``This node is not a swarm manager``. Resource names contain no
    whitespace and are matched as a single token after the phrase, so a name,
    or a file path inside a context message, can't supply another kind's phrase
    unless the path embeds a line break.

    When several lines name different kinds, the first kind in this order wins,
    regardless of line order: image, service, container, swarm manager, volume,
    network, config, secret, plugin, context. Unrecognized stderr, including a
    Swarm-mode ``volume <name> not found``, ``node <name> not found``, and
    ``no such task or service``, stays DockerException.

    The classifier reads whatever the CLI wrote to stderr. Application output
    that ``run`` or ``exec`` forwards there can still begin a line with one of
    these phrases and be misclassified. No attempt is made to prevent that.
