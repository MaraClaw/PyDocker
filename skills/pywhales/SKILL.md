  Use the installed pywhales package to automate Docker from Python applications
  and scripts. Use when translating docker run/build/compose commands into Python,
  managing containers or images with pywhales, pulling/pushing/saving/loading
  images, using Buildx or Compose from Python, adding telemetry or admission
  limits, bounding batch inspection, waiting for Swarm service/stack or Compose
  project convergence, or troubleshooting pywhales usage, output types,
  streaming, and cleanup. This skill is for consuming pywhales, not developing
  or contributing to the library.
compatibility: >-
  Python >=3.14.10 with pywhales installed; Docker CLI on PATH and a reachable
  Docker engine. Compose and Buildx plugins are required for their commands.

# PyWhales

Use the Python API that wraps the Docker CLI. Don't substitute Docker SDK APIs
or treat the `pywhales` console command as a Docker command runner.
This guidance describes current source APIs with project version 1.0.6.
An installed version string alone isn't proof of support; check actual
capabilities before use.

Work in the user's application or script with the installed package. A PyWhales
repository checkout, changes to its internals, and its contributor test suite
are not part of this workflow.

## Workflow

1. Identify the target context or host, project, input paths, and desired result.
   Keep existing resources separate from disposable resources the task creates.
2. Read the relevant reference below, not the whole bundle.
3. Check installed signatures, return annotations/overloads, and `help()` before
   adding unfamiliar arguments or assuming a closeable stream. For inventory,
   check supported kinds too. See [Usage validation](references/validation.md);
   these checks need no repository checkout or running engine.
4. Translate commands into argument sequences and verified keyword arguments.
   Choose captured output, detached objects, or streaming before writing code.
5. Scope clients instead of changing the user's active Docker context. Give owned
   containers and streams explicit lifetimes; don't attach cleanup to borrowed objects.
6. Validate the smallest authorized scenario. Report what ran, its output type,
   cleanup, and any unavailable engine or plugin checks.

## Quick Translation

| Docker CLI intent | PyWhales entry point |
| --- | --- |
| `docker run ...` | `docker.run(image, ["arg", ...], ...)` |
| `docker exec ...` | `docker.execute(container, ["arg", ...])`, not `docker.exec` |
| `docker ps` | `docker.ps()` or `docker.container.list()` |
| `docker build ...` | `docker.build(...)`, an alias of `docker.buildx.build(...)` |
| `docker compose ...` | A scoped `DockerClient(...).compose` namespace |

Pass commands as lists, not shell command strings. Use a shell inside the
container only when the task actually requires shell syntax. A detached run
returns a `Container`, not logs; a build doesn't always return a local `Image`.
Read the relevant output contract before consuming either result.
