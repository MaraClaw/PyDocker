# Client, Setup, and Errors

## Prerequisites

Use Python >=3.14.10. In a uv-managed application, add the dependency with
`uv add pywhales`. The package doesn't supply the Docker CLI: Docker must be on
PATH, and the selected engine must be reachable. Compose and Buildx commands
also need their respective Docker CLI plugins.

Check `docker version` for client/server connectivity. Check `docker compose
version` or `docker buildx version` only when that plugin is needed. A successful
Python import or client construction doesn't test any of these prerequisites;
CLI lookup is deferred until a command needs it.

## Choose a Client

```python
from pywhales import docker

version = docker.version()
if version.client is not None:
    print(version.client.version)
```

`docker` is a ready-made `DockerClient(client_type="docker")`. For a separate
target, construct a scoped client rather than changing the active CLI context:

```python
from pywhales import DockerClient

remote = DockerClient(host="ssh://user@host", client_type="docker")
staging = DockerClient(context="staging", client_type="docker")
```

Those are alternatives; select the host or context the user supplied. SSH
authentication and access to the remote engine must already work. Bind-mount
source paths refer to the daemon host, not automatically to the Python machine.

Keep Compose globals on its client: `compose_files`, `compose_profiles`,
`compose_project_name`, `compose_project_directory`, and `compose_env_files`.
Environment files are applied in order, with later files overriding earlier ones.

`environment={"KEY": "value"}` overlays entries on top of the inherited process
environment for every launch from that client; omitting it (`None`) inherits
the process environment unchanged. This does not affect executable lookup or
the parent Python process's own environment.

Keep this CLI configuration distinct from container `envs={...}`. Eligible
`envs` values use a per-launch child environment with `--env KEY`; CLI-control
names and environment collisions stay literal `KEY=VALUE` arguments. Neither
path is a secret vault. See
[Container environment values](containers-and-output.md#container-environment-values),
including the Compose interpolation caveat.

If passing an existing `client_config=...`, configure that object directly:
the constructor retains it unchanged and ignores the other constructor options.

## Default CLI Deadlines

`DockerClient(default_timeout=30)` applies a 30-second deadline to each local
CLI launch from that client. The default is `None`, which leaves launches
unbounded. Where a method accepts its own `timeout`, `None` inherits the
client default and a positive finite explicit value replaces it for the selected
launch(es) only. Booleans, zero, negatives, and nonfinite values are invalid;
`None` doesn't disable a configured default. This isn't a whole-operation budget:
preflight inspection, implicit image pulls, and postflight inspection are separate
launches governed by their own settings. Inherited defaults are snapshotted at
each launch, including lazy archive generators and queued transfers.

Expiry kills and reaps the local CLI and raises `DockerTimeout`, a subclass of
`DockerException` with the same `docker_command`/`return_code`/`stdout`/`stderr`
attributes. This happens even while archive consumption is paused or a producer
is blocked; arbitrary Python iterator code itself cannot be interrupted, so the
timeout is only reported when the caller's code resumes. It does not guarantee
daemon-side cancellation or rollback. See
[Containers, output, and lifecycle](containers-and-output.md) and
[Registry transfers and archives](registry-and-archives.md) for which methods
accept a per-call `timeout`.

## Handle the Right Failure

```python
from pywhales import ClientNotFoundError, DockerException, docker

try:
    version = docker.version()
except ClientNotFoundError as error:
    raise SystemExit("Docker CLI is missing or isn't on PATH.") from error
except DockerException as error:
    print(f"Docker command failed with exit code {error.return_code}")
    raise
else:
    if version.client is not None:
        print(version.client.version)
```

`ClientNotFoundError` is separate from `DockerException`. The latter represents
a CLI failure (including local deadline expiry) and exposes
`docker_command: list[str]`, `return_code: int`,
and `stdout`/`stderr` as `str | None`. Output can be `None` when it wasn't
captured. More specific errors, such as `NoSuchContainer`, `NoSuchImage`, and
`DockerTimeout` (a local CLI deadline expiry, not a daemon-side timeout), are
imported from `pywhales.exceptions`.

Use the exit code and relevant, redacted output to distinguish daemon access,
missing resources, registry authentication, and unsupported plugin flags.
Don't retry a mutating command just because it failed. Invalid Python arguments
may raise `TypeError` or `ValueError` before a subprocess is started.

For registry login, `docker.login(server=..., username=..., password=...)`
passes the password through stdin, always requesting `--password-stdin`.
Omitting `password` (`None`) still requests `--password-stdin` but inherits
the caller's own stdin instead of writing a value; pass an explicit password
when running non-interactively. Obtain credentials from the application's
existing secret mechanism; don't embed them in generated examples or reports.

## Troubleshooting Without Credential Leaks

`PYWHALES_DEBUG=1` enables execution diagnostics, with command and environment
values withheld by default. A separate `DockerClient(raw_diagnostics=True)`
opts into detailed logs and errors, including the merged environment in debug
printing and inspect-response dumps on model failures. Use that opt-in only in
a trusted troubleshooting environment. Only the exact value `1` enables debug
printing. Raw exception attributes, returned
payloads, uncaptured terminal output, and caller logging remain outside this
policy.

Malformed responses from Buildx builder reload/list, Compose config/ls/events,
system disk-free/events/info, and imagetools manifest parsing raise
`ParsingError` from `pywhales.client_config`, not a `ValueError` subclass.
Safe mode suppresses the payload-bearing parsing chain; raw diagnostics chains
the original error. Event parsing keeps the launch-time diagnostics setting.
`version()` and container stats keep their existing exception behavior.

If an argument is rejected, inspect that method in the installed package before
changing versions or guessing SDK-style names. New Compose flags are forwarded
to the plugin without a compatibility probe or automatic fallback.

limits around specific calls, see
[Telemetry and admission](telemetry-and-admission.md). For bounding batch
inspection or waiting for Swarm service/stack or Compose project convergence,
see [Observation budgets and convergence](observation-and-convergence.md).
