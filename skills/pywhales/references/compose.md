# Compose

## Scope Files and Project

Set Compose globals on a dedicated `DockerClient`, not on `compose.up()`.
`compose_files` accepts an ordered sequence of files. Use
`compose_env_files=[".env", ".env.local"]` for ordered environment files and
`compose_profiles=["test"]` when those inputs exist and the task needs them.
Don't change the user's active Docker context to select a Compose target.

For the disposable example below, put this in `compose.yaml` in the working
directory. For an existing project, use its actual files and service names.

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: alpine:3.22
    command: ["sleep", "300"]
```

```python
from uuid import uuid4

from pywhales import DockerClient

client = DockerClient(
    compose_files=["compose.yaml"],
    compose_project_name=f"pywhales-demo-{uuid4().hex[:8]}",
    client_type="docker",
)
try:
    client.compose.up(["app"], detach=True, wait=True, wait_timeout=60)
    print(client.compose.execute("app", ["echo", "ready"], tty=False))
    print(client.compose.logs(["app"], tail="20"))
finally:
    client.compose.down()
```

This creates an isolated project and tears down its containers and networks.
`down()` keeps volumes by default. Use this cleanup only for a project you own
and are authorized to remove, not a shared stack. `volumes=True` also removes
declared named volumes and attached anonymous volumes; request it only when
deleting that data is part of the task. `remove_images` is another explicit
deletion choice, not a default cleanup setting.

## Output and Service Selection

| Operation | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `client.compose.build(...)` | `None`; normal output is displayed |
| `client.compose.up(...)` | `None`; it doesn't return containers or captured logs |
| Either with `stream_logs=True` | Owned `(source, bytes)` stream; `None` for an explicit empty service list |
| `client.compose.ps()` | `list[Container]` for the selected project |
| `client.compose.logs(...)` | `str`; use `stream=True` for `(source, bytes)` |
| `client.compose.execute(service, command, tty=False)` | `str`; detached or TTY execution returns `None` |
| `client.compose.run(service, command, tty=False)` | `str`; `detach=True` returns `Container`, `stream=True` returns a tuple stream |

`source` is `"stdout"` or `"stderr"`, never `"stdin"`. These streams own local
CLI processes and support context-manager cleanup; drain them to observe
failures. Closing them doesn't tear down the project.

For `build` and `up`, `services=None` means all services while `services=[]`
means no work. `pull` has the same selection rule; `ps` and `logs` instead
treat both `None` and `[]` as all services. Don't normalize these differences.
`up` and `run` enable dependencies by default; `build`'s separate
`with_dependencies` option defaults to `False`.
`quiet=True` is incompatible with `stream_logs=True`.

## Distinguish Timeout Meanings

`down`, `restart`, and `stop` accept `timeout` as a Compose shutdown grace
period forwarded to the CLI, not a local subprocess deadline. `down` accepts
integer seconds; `restart` and `stop` also accept a `timedelta`, truncated to
whole seconds. These launches can still raise `DockerTimeout` if the client's
separate `default_timeout` expires.

`run`, `logs`, `pull`, `push`, `watch`, and `events` instead accept a
keyword-only `timeout` in positive finite seconds that replaces the client's
`default_timeout` for that one local CLI launch; `None` inherits it. Expiry
kills and reaps the local Compose CLI and raises `DockerTimeout`, which keeps
whatever output was captured; it does not stop services, undo pulled or pushed
layers, or guarantee that daemon-side or registry work stops. `pull`, `push`,
and `watch` validate it before the empty-selection no-op: an invalid value
raises `ValueError` even for `services=[]`, while a valid one with `[]` returns
`None` without a launch. A returned stream's deadline keeps advancing while
nothing consumes it, so drain it or close it on early exit.

Don't confuse the two: `compose.up(wait_timeout=60)` is a third, separate
concept, the Compose-side `--wait-timeout` bound on service readiness, not a
local CLI deadline either.

## One-Off Commands and TTY Defaults

Both `compose.run` and `compose.execute` default to `tty=True`. Set `tty=False`
for captured output and unattended jobs. `compose.run` also rejects TTY plus
streaming, TTY plus detach, and detach plus streaming.

With the client and disposable Compose file above, a one-off job is:

```python
output = client.compose.run(
    "app", ["echo", "job complete"], tty=False, remove=True, dependencies=False
)
print(output)
```

`remove=True` removes that job container after exit; it doesn't clean up any
separately started service containers. Use `execute` for a command in an
already-running service. Collect logs separately from `up`; `follow=True` is
potentially unbounded, so use `stream=True` with a deliberate stop boundary.

## Plugin Features and Previews

`wait=True` waits for running/healthy services and implies detached mode in
Compose. Newer options, such as build `check`/`print` and up `watch` or
`exit_code_from`, require a supporting plugin. PyWhales forwards flags without
version probing or automatic downgrade. Blocking `compose.build(print=True)`
still returns `None`; stream it if the output must be consumed.

`compose.watch(...)` itself returns an owned `(source, bytes)` stream; it
doesn't take `stream_logs=True`. It defaults to `prune=False` (explicitly
forwarded as `--prune=false`, and `--prune=true` only when requested), and an
explicit empty service list returns `None` without invoking the CLI. A watch
can run until stopped: pass a `timeout` or a deliberate stop boundary, and use
the stream as a context manager. Closing it reaps the local CLI without
removing running services.

`wait=True` is a Compose CLI option applied during `up`. To check afterward
that a chosen set of services settled, use the read-only
`pywhales.convergence.capture_compose()` and `wait()`, documented in
[Observation budgets and convergence](observation-and-convergence.md). Capture
takes explicit, distinct service names for the client's configured project, and
a one-shot container that exited 0 stays a blocker, so select long-running
services only.

Preview mode is the client global `compose_dry_run=True`, not an `up()` keyword.
Use a separate preview client with the same files/project settings. It still
invokes the Compose plugin, and not every command supports dry run.
`compose.ps()` and detached `compose.run()` reject this mode before execution
because preview output cannot supply real container objects. Don't treat it
as an offline validator or disable the preview silently to make a call work.
