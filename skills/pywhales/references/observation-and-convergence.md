# Observation Budgets And Convergence

Import bounded observation/inventory APIs from the `pywhales` package root,
`bulk_reload` from `pywhales.client_config`, and convergence APIs from
`pywhales.convergence`. All are opt-in; none changes ordinary `DockerClient`
calls automatically.

## Bounding Batch Inspection

```python
from threading import Event
from time import monotonic

from pywhales import (
    DockerClient,
    InspectionPolicy,
    InventoryRequest,
    capture_inventory,
    observation,
)

client = DockerClient()
policy = InspectionPolicy(
    max_references=100,
    max_argv_bytes=32768,
    max_response_bytes=1_048_576,
    max_total_references=200,
    max_total_response_bytes=4_194_304,
)
cancel = Event()
request = InventoryRequest(
    kind="container",
    references=("authorized-container-name",),
    client_config=client.client_config,
)

with observation(policy, deadline=monotonic() + 30.0, cancel=cancel):
    snapshot = capture_inventory([request], policy=policy)
```

`InspectionPolicy(max_references=..., max_argv_bytes=..., max_response_bytes=...)`
requires three positive integers; there's no default policy. Optional
`max_total_references`, `max_total_response_bytes`, and `max_total_stream_bytes` default to `None`,
leaving aggregate accounting unbounded. The illustrative limits above aren't
a universal sizing recommendation. `observation()`
is a context manager applying those limits, plus an optional absolute
monotonic `deadline` and a `cancel` `Event`, to synchronous list/inspect
calls executed through it. Nested scopes can only tighten the active limits,
never loosen them, and the scope applies to the current context only; it
doesn't automatically propagate to worker threads you spawn inside it.

The scope's restrictions belong to the shared synchronous captured path (the
path list/inspect-style calls use). Inside a scope, that path rejects `tty`,
uncaptured output, and `input` with `ValueError`, and charges the captured
stdout/stderr bytes to the response budgets. Streams and archive transfers
follow a separate launch lifecycle, described under the limits below. Don't use
`observation()` as a general command sandbox.

`capture_inventory(items, *, policy)` accepts a mix of `InventoryRequest`
objects and existing resource handles, and returns an `InventorySnapshot`
whose `records` tuple holds one `InventoryRecord` (`kind`, `id`, `payload`) per
requested occurrence, in request order, duplicates kept. Each `payload` is a
deep copy, independent of every other record and of the input handles, so
mutating one changes nothing else. Capture never changes an existing handle's
own cache. Supported kinds are thirteen: `container`, `image`, `network`,
`volume`, `node`, `service`, `config`, `secret`, `task`, `plugin`, `context`,
`builder`, and `manifest_list`. `InventoryRequest.references` must be a nonempty tuple of
nonempty strings, else `ValueError`. Empty input launches no CLI. Request
shape, total reference count, and each reference's argv and environment limits
are checked for every group before the first inspect launch.

Builders have no batch inspect command, so they work differently. All builder
requests sharing the same `ClientConfig` object use one strict
`buildx ls --format "{{json . }}"` listing per capture or reload call, and names
never reach argv. Each
requested name must match a listed builder name exactly; an absent name raises
`ParsingError`, and duplicate requests each get their own record, in order. The
listing is parsed whole: node rows repeat a builder's line byte for byte and
collapse, but a non-builder line, a null or empty name, or two different lines
under one name rejects the entire listing. Error text omits builder names
unless the client sets `raw_diagnostics=True`. Because no name enters argv,
`max_references` and `max_argv_bytes` neither chunk nor grow with builder
requests, but each requested name still counts toward `max_total_references`,
and the listing's stdout/stderr bytes are charged to `max_response_bytes` and
`max_total_response_bytes` like any captured call.

`bulk_reload(handles, policy=policy)` from `pywhales.client_config` refreshes
existing handles of the same thirteen kinds, `Builder` and `ManifestList` included. It validates
every input kind and identity before any lookup, groups by the exact client
configuration object plus kind, and inspects each distinct handle once; the
same handle object passed twice is published once, while separate handle
objects for one resource each receive a snapshot. It stages and identity-checks
every group before updating any handle's cache or timestamp, so a failure in
any group leaves all caches unchanged. Publication then runs handle by handle,
which isn't a daemon transaction and isn't atomic to concurrent readers. When
`policy` is omitted, an active `observation()` scope applies instead, and
outside such a scope its existing unbounded behavior is unchanged.

### Manifest Lists

Use registry references, not local image IDs, for `manifest_list` inventory:

```python
request = InventoryRequest(
    kind="manifest_list",
    references=("registry.example.com/team/app:release",),
    client_config=client.client_config,
)
snapshot = capture_inventory([request], policy=policy)
```

Requests use secure inspection. Existing `ManifestList` handles are accepted
too and retain their own `insecure` setting; there's no request-level insecure
option. Each reference gets a singleton manifest inspect, not a batch command.
`record.id` binds the exact requested reference, not a digest from the response.
Records stay detached and ordered, with a separate record for each duplicate.

As with other kinds, `bulk_reload` groups by the exact `ClientConfig` object,
not equality, and stages and validates all groups before publishing any cache
updates. A failure leaves all input caches untouched. Public
`client.manifest.inspect()` and an individual `ManifestList.reload()` keep their
existing lenient behavior; don't assume this bounded-capture validation there.

The per-command reference limit bounds each inspect batch; aggregate reference
accounting counts all requested occurrences, including duplicates, in one
inventory/bulk-reload call. The response limit counts combined raw stdout/stderr bytes per
invocation. Exceeding a limit raises `ObservationLimitError`; an expired
deadline raises `ObservationTimeout`; a set `cancel` event raises
`ObservationCancelled`. Failures stop/reap an active owned local CLI when one
exists; some limits reject before launch. Nothing rolls back daemon-side work,
and the regular, selected-launch
`DockerTimeout` from `default_timeout`/`timeout=` is unaffected and can still
fire independently.

Streams and archive transfers (log and progress streams, `load`, `save`) can
retain a scope's lifecycle instead. Started inside a scope, they check
cancellation and the argv and environment limits before launch, keep the
scope's deadline and tokens after the `with` block exits, and kill and reap the
local CLI before raising `ObservationTimeout` or `ObservationCancelled`; a lazy
`save` binds the scope active at its first iteration. Streamed or archive
payload bytes are not charged to response budgets, and these launches aren't
subject to the captured-output rejection above. Multi-image `pull`/`push` run
each task in a copy of the calling context, so a non-streaming
`pull(quiet=False)` inside a scope raises the same `ValueError` for one image
or many, while `stream_logs=True` accepts `quiet=False` there.

Set `max_total_stream_bytes` to bound combined stream/archive stdout and stderr
bytes as pipe readers pull them, including buffered read-ahead. Each enclosing
scope with this field set owns a separate account; each read charges all of them,
even after the launching scope exits. Captured output never consumes this budget.
Overflow stops and reaps the local CLI and delivers `ObservationLimitError` with
reason `total_stream` once. Archive watchdog drains and the stderr read that
selects a Docker exception are uncharged. Leaving the field unset changes no
stream or archive accounting.

Aggregate response budgets apply within observation scopes and the bounded
inventory call. Snapshots aren't daemon transactions or total memory caps.

## Waiting For Convergence

`pywhales.convergence` is an opt-in, read-only observer of one fixed target:
a captured Swarm service generation (`capture_service` returns a
`ServiceTarget`), an explicit Swarm stack (`StackTarget`), or selected Compose
services (`capture_compose` returns a `ComposeTarget`). `wait()` takes any of
the three. Existing mutating calls never invoke it automatically; capture and
wait yourself after submitting the change you want to confirm. Choose the
Swarm path for `docker service`/`docker stack` deployments and the Compose path
for a `docker compose` project.

### Swarm Service Or Stack

```python
from threading import Event

from pywhales import DockerClient, InspectionPolicy
from pywhales.convergence import ServiceTarget, capture_service, wait

client = DockerClient()
policy = InspectionPolicy(
    max_references=32, max_argv_bytes=65536, max_response_bytes=1_048_576
)
cancel = Event()

target = capture_service(
    client, "full-service-id", policy=policy, timeout=10, cancel=cancel
)
if isinstance(target, ServiceTarget):
    outcome = wait(target, policy=policy, timeout=120, poll_interval=1, cancel=cancel)
```

`client.service.update()`, `client.stack.deploy()`, and rollback retain their
existing behavior. Always pass the exact, immutable service ID returned by your
own submission, not a name; the caller must know the complete, fixed membership
of a stack before building a `StackTarget`, never inferred from a live,
possibly-changing discovery.

`capture_service(client, service_id, *, policy, timeout, cancel=None, approved_node_ids=None)`
returns a `ServiceTarget`, or a typed `Failure`/`Deadline`/`Cancelled`
outcome. It records the service's version and a fingerprint of its desired
task template and mode at that instant. Replicated services need an explicit
nonnegative replica count; Global services need `approved_node_ids`, a
nonempty tuple of distinct node IDs, at capture time, since there's no
automatic discovery of "eligible" nodes.

Use an authorized service's actual immutable ID in place of the placeholder.
Keep the target's originating `ClientConfig` stable while waiting. Unsupported
job modes and malformed service/task data fail closed.

`wait(target, *, policy, timeout, poll_interval, cancel=None)` accepts a
`ServiceTarget`, a `StackTarget(services=(...))`, or a `ComposeTarget` and
returns `Success`, `Failure`, `Deadline`, or `Cancelled`. For Swarm targets,
only current desired-running tasks count; a changed service version or template
fingerprint returns `superseded`; `paused`/`failed`/rollback states are
terminal `update_failed` failures. Snapshot collection isn't an atomic Swarm
transaction, so a final generation recheck reduces, but can't remove, races
from concurrent changes. A successful result proves the captured
task-generation conditions, not application health or readiness.

### Compose Project

```python
from pywhales.convergence import (
    Cancelled,
    ComposeTarget,
    Deadline,
    Failure,
    Success,
    capture_compose,
    wait,
)

# `policy` and `cancel` are the InspectionPolicy and Event from the Swarm
# example. The client's Compose settings select the project.
compose_client = DockerClient(
    compose_files=["compose.yaml"], compose_project_name="demo"
)
services = ("web", "migrate")  # web stays running; migrate must finish

match capture_compose(
    compose_client,
    services,
    completion_services=("migrate",),
    policy=policy,
    timeout=10,
    cancel=cancel,
):
    case ComposeTarget() as target:
        outcome = wait(
            target, policy=policy, timeout=120, poll_interval=1, cancel=cancel
        )
        converged = isinstance(outcome, Success)
    case Failure(reason=reason):
        print(f"Compose capture failed: {reason}")
    case Deadline() | Cancelled() as stopped:
        print(f"Compose capture stopped: {type(stopped).__name__}")
```

`capture_compose(client, services, *, completion_services: tuple[str, ...] = (), policy, timeout, cancel=None)` returns a
`ComposeTarget` or a typed `Failure`/`Deadline`/`Cancelled`, so check for the
target before waiting. Capture after `compose up` has returned, so the target
fixes the containers you mean to wait for, and keep the client's Compose
settings (files, profiles, project name and directory, env files) stable while
waiting.

- `services` is an explicit, nonempty `tuple` of distinct, nonempty names, never
  discovered. A list, an empty tuple, duplicates, or a client created with
  `compose_dry_run=True` raise `ValueError` before any launch.
- `completion_services` is a tuple of distinct selected names, fixed at capture;
  a list, duplicates, or a name outside `services` raises `ValueError` before
  launch. The default `()` leaves every selected service long-running.
- Capture lists the selected services' containers with stopped ones included,
  inspects each, and skips one-off `compose run` containers. For every selected
  service the target records the full container IDs and the single
  `com.docker.compose.config-hash`. A hash covers the service configuration, not
  its replica count; the fixed container IDs cover that. Because the target
  holds container IDs, keep it out of untrusted output.
- A selected service with no containers, or with containers carrying different
  hashes, is `Failure(reason="unsupported")`. A missing hash, a container outside
  the selection, or unusable CLI output is `Failure(reason="malformed")` with no
  cause. A CLI failure, missing executable, or exceeded limit is
  `reason="observation"` and carries its cause.
- Every polling cycle re-lists the project and re-inspects the members. An added,
  vanished, or recreated container (any change to the ID set) or a changed
  service label or config hash is `superseded`, so a scale-up or recreate after
  capture ends the wait instead of moving the target.
- An unmarked service's container counts as ready only when it is `running`, not restarting, not
  paused, and `healthy` whenever a healthcheck is configured; a configured
  healthcheck with no health status yet blocks, and a `NONE` healthcheck test
  counts as none. A container that exited 0, such as a one-shot job, isn't
  running and stays a blocker unless its service was marked for completion.
- A marked service completes only when every captured container is `exited`
  with `ExitCode` 0 and not restarting. Created, running, or restarting
  containers remain unfinished. A non-restarting container exited nonzero ends
  the wait with payload-free `Failure(reason="completion_failed")`: no cause,
  exit code, or container ID is included. An exited completion container with a
  missing or malformed `ExitCode` yields `Failure(reason="malformed")` with no
  cause. A service with no containers is still `unsupported`, not complete.
- When a cycle finds all long-running services ready and completion services
  finished, `wait()` lists and checks the project again. `Success` requires
  that mandatory second pass to satisfy the same conditions and be unchanged.
  It proves the captured conditions at that moment, not application readiness
  beyond the configured healthchecks.

### Outcomes And Budgets

These rules apply to every target. `timeout` on capture and wait is a positive
finite total budget for that call, unlike a per-launch CLI timeout; cleanup
can outlast it. `poll_interval` is also positive finite seconds.
`Deadline.detail`, when present, is a payload-free aggregate from the last
complete polling cycle, not live state at expiry; it's absent when capture
expired or no cycle finished. It holds `captured_services` plus counts of
affected services per reason, each service counted at most once per reason and
reasons allowed to overlap. For Compose the long-running readiness counters are
`non_running_containers`, `restarting_containers`, `paused_containers`, and `unhealthy_containers` (a
configured healthcheck that isn't `healthy`, including still `starting` or not
yet reported). A restarting or paused container also counts as non-running.
`unfinished_completion_containers` counts affected completion services, not
individual containers or replicas; the other readiness counters exclude
completion services.

A `Failure.cause` or a target's `template` may hold confidential wire data; they
stay out of `repr()`, but don't log them without a confidentiality policy.
Cancellation or deadline expiry reaps only the local CLI child; it never cancels
or rolls back daemon-side Swarm or Compose work.

## Optional Application Reconciliation

`pywhales.reconciliation` exports `Controller`, `JournalStore`, operation/lease
types, and explicit inventory/mutation/convergence adapter contracts. This is an
application-owned, one-pass journal workflow (`submit`, `claim`, `reconcile`),
not an automatic Docker scheduler or a wrapper that changes ordinary calls.
The application supplies adapters and a production durable store; the included
`MemoryJournalStore` is a thread-safe, nondurable conformance fake, not
process-crash recovery. Unknown mutation outcomes aren't automatically replayed.
Leases don't fence Docker itself; there is no exactly-once guarantee or built-in
reset/retry/delete workflow. Check installed signatures and the application's
ownership/recovery design before opting in; don't replace failed mutating calls
with blind retries.
The journal's convergence failure vocabulary also accepts `completion_failed`.
